# Hi, I'm Shashi 👋

I'm a Product Manager who builds tools to solve his own problems—then open-sources them.

7+ years in Data Products, Analytics & BI. Currently building at a stealth startup in Seattle.

Most of my work lives in PRDs and roadmaps, but lately I've been shipping code. Not because I'm a developer—because I got tired of waiting for solutions that didn't exist.

### What I'm Building

- - **Split It** *(coming soon)* — Bill splitting app featured in [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/what-people-are-vibe-coding-and-actually)

          *I'm not a developer. I'm a PM who taught himself to code. If something here is broken, tell me—I'm learning in public.*
