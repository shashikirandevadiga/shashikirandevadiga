  # Hi, I'm Shashi 👋

  I'm a Product Manager who builds tools to solve his own problems.

  7+ years in Data Products, Analytics & BI. Currently building at a stealth startup in Seattle.

  Most of my work lives in PRDs and roadmaps, but lately I've been shipping code. Not because I'm a developer, because I got tired of waiting for solutions that didn't exist.

  ### What I'm Building
  - **[apply-pilot](https://github.com/shashikirandevadiga/apply-pilot)** — 8-agent AI system that automates job applications. Built with Claude Code + Python. 45 mins → 5 mins per application.
  - **[Split-it](https://github.com/shashikirandevadiga/Split-it)** — Bill splitting app featured in [Lenny's Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/what-people-are-vibe-coding-and-actually)

  ### What I Write About
  - AI workflows for PMs who don't code
  - Job search automation & strategies
  - Building in public as a non-developer

  *I'm not a developer. I'm a PM who taught himself to code. If something here is broken, tell me—I'm learning in public.*
